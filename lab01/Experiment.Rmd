### Title Page

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r comment = NA}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center', message = FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
EPIDURALF$ease <- factor(EPIDURALF$ease, levels = c("Easy", "Difficult", "Impossible"))
ggplot2::ggplot(data = EPIDURALF, aes(x = cm, y = kg, color = ease)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r message = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
all_values <- function(x) {
  if(is.null(x)) return(NULL)
  paste0(names(x), ": ", format(x), collapse = "<br />")
}
library(ggvis)
EPIDURALF %>%
  ggvis(~cm, ~kg, fill = ~ease) %>%
  layer_points() %>%
  group_by(ease) %>%
  layer_model_predictions(formula = kg ~ cm, model = "lm", se = TRUE) %>%
  add_tooltip(all_values, "hover")
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(PASWR2)
kable(head(EPIDURALF), padding = 0, align = "r")
```


```{r}
library(ggvis)
levels(EPIDURALF$ease)
EPIDURALF %>%
 ggvis(~kg, fill = ~ease) %>%
 group_by(ease) %>%
 layer_densities(stroke = ~ease, fill = ~ease,   adjust = input_slider(0.1, 5, label = "Hold Down the Mouse and Move Me"))
```


```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, comment = NA,fig.align='center'}
library(PASWR2)
library(dplyr)
xtabs(~ease, data = EPIDURALF)
EPI <- EPIDURALF %>%
       mutate(BMI = kg/(cm/100)^2)
EPI$ease <- factor(EPI$ease, levels = c("Easy", "Difficult", "Impossible"))    
head(EPI)
xtabs(~ease, data = EPI)
levels(EPI$ease)
#  levels in legend shown in proper order as expected.
EPI %>%
  ggvis(~cm, ~kg, fill = ~ease) %>%
  layer_points() %>%
  group_by(ease) %>%
  layer_model_predictions(formula = kg ~ cm, model = "lm", se = TRUE)
# layer_boxplots() does not show levels of factor in proper order in legend (shows them alphabetically)
EPI %>%
  ggvis(~ease, ~BMI, fill = ~ease) %>%
  layer_boxplots()
# I would expect it to respect the levels of the factor as does ggplot2 below (Easy, Difficult, Impossible)
ggplot(data = EPI, aes(x = ease, y = BMI, fill = ease)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
# Legend does not respect levels of factor ease for layer_densities().
EPI %>%
 group_by(ease) %>%
 ggvis(~BMI, fill = ~ease) %>%
 layer_densities(stroke = ~ease, fill = ~ease)
# I would expect the legend to appear as below (Easy, Difficult, Impossible)
ggplot(data = EPI, aes(x = BMI, fill = ease)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, aes(color = ease)) + theme_bw()
#
# library(plyr)
# DF <- ddply(EPI, .(ease, doctor), summarize, mbmi = mean(BMI))
# DF

# Doing the same thing with dplyr
library(dplyr)
DF2 <- EPI %>%
  group_by(ease, doctor) %>%
  summarize(mbmi = mean(BMI))
ggplot(data = DF2, aes(x = ease, y = mbmi, fill = doctor)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "Identity") + theme_bw()
