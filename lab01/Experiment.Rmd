### Title Page

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r comment = NA}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center', message = FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
ggplot2::ggplot(data = EPIDURALF, aes(x = cm, y = kg, color = ease)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Column1 |column2 | column3|
--------|--------|---------
23 | 35 | 34 |

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(PASWR2)
kable(head(EPIDURALF), padding = 0, align = "r")
```
