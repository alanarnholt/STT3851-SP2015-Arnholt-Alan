This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r "FirstChunk", prompt=TRUE, comment=NA}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r "Picture", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(cars, col = "pink", pch=19)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Load the Gap Minder Data

```{r comment = NA}
site <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanarnholt/STT3851-SP2015-Arnholt-Alan/master/Data/PDSdata/Gapminder/gapminder.csv"
library(repmis)
GMD <- source_data(site)
dim(GMD)
head(GMD)
```
