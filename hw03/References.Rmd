The only references from your `bibliography.bib` file that will appear at the end of a document are those that have been cited in the text.  You can use `nocite` to get a full bibliography but we will not discuss that further here.  When you create your `*.Rmd` file, you will need to add the line `bibliography: bibliography.bib` to the YAML metadata section.

To create a `bibliography.bib`, 

* First, highlight the titles you want to select in Zotero.  
* Next, for Windows users, right click on the highlighted items; for Mac users, Control-click on the highlighted items. 
* Then, select **Export Items**.  Use the drop down menu to select **BibLaTeX** as the format. 
* Fourth, click OK.  Change the name of the file to `bibliography.bib` in the **Save As:** box. 
* Finally, click **Save**.


I will use [@beck2014; @rich2013; @murp2012; @dean2014] for this work.  Plus, @beck2014 says I am full of myself.
